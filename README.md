This repository provides the codes and experiments for the paper "An adaptive superfast inexact proximal
augmented Lagrangian method for smooth nonconvex composite optimization problems" by Arnesh Sujanani and Renato D.C. Monteiro. 

Folders, "QP Vector Simplex Codes", "QP Vector Box", "SDP Simplex", "Sparse PCA codes", and "Matrix Completion" codes contain both my codes
and the experiments running the other benchmark algorithms used to generate the tables in the paper for each problem class respectively. The folder,
"Codes of Other Benchmark Algorithms" contains the actual codes of the algorithms we compare our algorithm with. These codes as well as the codes which generate the various problem classes were generously provided by William Kong.

In order to run both my codes and all experiments, please download William Kong's github repository nc_opt https://github.com/wwkong/nc_opt (in addition 
to this repository) as the codes may make use of prox utility functions which can be found be found there.
